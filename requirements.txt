## Step 1: Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

Using a virtual environment helps you isolate project dependencies from other Python projects on your machine.

### 1. Create a Virtual Environment
Run the following command to create a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv myenv
```

### 2. Activate the Virtual Environment
Activate the virtual environment based on your operating system:

- **On macOS/Linux**:
  ```bash
  source myenv/bin/activate
  ```

- **On Windows**:
  ```bash
  myenv\Scripts\activate
  ```

### 3. Install Necessary Libraries
Install the required libraries for your project using `pip`:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly
```

This command installs the libraries and their versions necessary for your project into the virtual environment.

## Versions for `requirements.txt`

Below are the specific library versions for this project. Save these lines into a file named `requirements.txt` for easier setup:

```
numpy==1.23.0
pandas==1.4.3
matplotlib==3.5.2
seaborn==0.11.2
plotly==5.7.0
```

### Why This Works
By removing unnecessary indentation before the triple backticks, GitHub Markdown will correctly interpret the code blocks. Paste this directly into your `README.md` file, and the code blocks will render properly.
